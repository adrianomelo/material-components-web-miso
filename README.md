A demo website is planned.
For now please refer to the elm repository. The implemented components work exactly the same.

## Contribution
Every contribution is welcome. Whether you want to implement a new component, improve the documentation or help new users!

It is highly recommended to join the Miso community on Slack: https://haskell-miso-slack.herokuapp.com/

In case you want to contribute a component here is a script that makes converting from Elm to Miso a little easier:
